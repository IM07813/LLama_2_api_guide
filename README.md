**Harness the power of Llama 2 API with this handy guide to set it up and run in your terminal using Replicate!**

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.11 or later
- Replicate account and API token

**Steps:**

1. **Virtualize Your Environment:**
   Create a virtual environment for isolation (if needed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3.11-venv  # On Linux/Ubuntu
   python3 -m venv llama2_api        # Replace "llama2_api" with your desired name
   ```

2. **Activate Your Virtual World:**
   Enter your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source llama2_api/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Invite Replicate In:**
   Install Replicate within your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pip install replicate
   ```

4. **Unlock Replicate's Magic:**
   Get your API token from [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens): [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) and set it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_UCY**********************************
   ```

   **Remember to replace the stars with your actual token!**

5. **Craft Your Project Space:**
   Create a directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir llama2_api
   cd llama2_api
   ```

6. **Acquire the Script:**
   Download the `replit_python.py` script and place it in this directory.

7. **Let the Creativity Flow:**
   Run the script with your desired prompt and seed:

   ```bash
   python3 replit_python.py "your prompt" <seed>
   ```

   For example, to run the prompt "how are you" with seed 123:

   ```bash
   python3 replit_python.py "how are you" 123
   ```

**Tips & Tricks:**

- Influence response generation by replacing `<seed>` with a numerical value.
